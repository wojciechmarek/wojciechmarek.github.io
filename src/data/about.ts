  "Because you are here, let me tell you something more about me... To make a long story short, create web applications using Angular, React, and Nest.js. Previously I have worked with C# language and .NET framework, but JavaScript (or, to be more precise - Typescript) took my heart.",
  "I started my journey with programming at the end of 2012, playing with C programming language to create simple batch programs that run the ATMega16 micro-controller. Having some experience with C, I have decided to learn C++ to make some console programs to automate some tasks on my computer. I have also started to learn about object-oriented programming and design patterns.",
  "Then I decided to start a computer science course at the local college (2016) to learn more about programming and computer science in general. I have learned about algorithms, data structures, databases, operating systems, computer networks, etc. I have also learned about C# programming language and the .NET framework. Having better knowledge about that, I have started to build Windows apps using Windows Forms and WPF. Here I also started to learn about web development using Angular framework in the most recent version 6th (beginning of 2019).",
  "I started my first job as a Junior .Net Developer in the October of 2018 as a working student. After seven months, I decided to use my student status to visit the United States of America for four months working on a J1 visa. After returning to Poland, I started my first real job as a Junior Software Engineer. Until now, I have kept learning new things and technologies to become a better developer and finally create software that will change the world ðŸš€."
